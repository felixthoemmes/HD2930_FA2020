# Syllabus highlights
<br/>
<br/>


- Classes are interactive and based on an active learning framework

- Pre-class readings are required, and graded based on holistic algorithm

- Weekly graded coding assignments

- One mid-term project

- One final project

---

# Class structure  
<br/>
<br/>

- 30-45 minutes of reading rehearsal   

- 60 minutes of active learning in small groups  

- 30-45 minutes of sharing results of active learning  

---

# Pre-class readings
<br/>
<br/>


- Readings are assigned weekly, and must be completed before class

- Textbooks are free, and open-source, and are put online in the Perusall system

- You must read, and annotate the text in the Persual system

- Other students can see your annotations, and can react to them

- Readings are graded using a holistic algorithm

- The algorithm takes into account how much time you spend reading the chapters, how much you annotate, and whether your annotations are of high quality

---

# Assignments

<br/>
<br/>


- Weekly assignments solidify programming concepts that we practiced in class

- Assignments are always due on Monday, 5pm

- Assignments must be written in RMarkdown and are submitted and graded on Canvas

- Assignments make up most of your grade


---

# Plagiarism

<br/>
<br/>


- The web is full of code (e.g., StackOverflow), and you are allowed to use *all* of it

- There is a website that contains answers to every exercise question in our textbook

- Cite all outside work (e.g., include StackOverflow URL)

- Keep in mind that copying code from the Web is OK, but it is even better if you also understand the code you copied

# Discussion board

<br/>
<br/>

- Use the discussion board!

- We love to help you, especially after you made an effort yourself

- It does not improve your learning, if you struggle for hours over a single R command 

- Reach out instead!

### Bad questions:

* How do you do problem 2?
* My code is  broken. How do I fix it?

.pull-right[
### Good questions:
* Here's a snippet of code I used for problem 2: 
<br/>`formatted code snippet`
<br/>It returned the following error:
<br/>`formatted error message`
<br/>Does anyone know why? I already tried...

# Discussion board

.pull-left[
### Bad answers:
* Here's my solution
* Fool! You should already know the answer to this! Your trivial question is no match for my superior intellect!
]

.pull-right[
### Good answers:
* This error message occurs because your variable is a string instead of a numeric.
Have you tried checking...
* I think you have a bug in line 3 of the code you posted. You have more left parenthesis than right parenthesis so the line is incomplete.

# Active Learning

<br/>
<br/>

- During each lesson, we will create break-out rooms of 6-8 students

- Assignment to rooms is semi-random

- You will be given some data science task that you should try to solve

- You are expected to produce some final product for each of these activities

- You are further expected to share these products with the class at the end of each class

- You are given a grade for these activities

---


# Final project

<br/>
<br/>

- Your project consist of a full report on a data science project of your choice

- This will include sourcing data, summarizing, and analyzing it

- Production of high-quality, publication-ready graphs, and tables

- Report should consist of an introduction, data sources, analysis, results, and discussion section

# Active Learning Session (Lab)

<br/>
<br/>

- This first "active learning" lab is designed to get your toolkit ready 
 
- You will now be assigned to breakout rooms

- Retrieve the document "Lab1.pdf" from Canvas and follow instructions

- We will come together in one hour

- We will be available to help during this time
